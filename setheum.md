Setheum DeFi & DeCo Network by Setheum Labs

Setheum Labs props, supports, nurtures and stewards applications in the fields of Decentralized Finance protocols particularly e-commerce and protocols that can serve as open finance building blocks such as stable currency and synthetic assets. Setheum Network is a focal R&D project initiated the Setheum Labs. Setheum Labs is founded by Muhammad-Jibril B.A. participant of the Polkadot ecosystem.

Project Description

We are building a decentralized, cross-chain, community-owned DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and DeCo (Decentralized Commerce) system - the Setheum Network, to enable true economic interoperability, cross-chain liquidity and scalability. Along with the system, we are also building an economic model and governance framework to sustain the development, and continuous participation in the Polkadot ecosystem (e.g. as parachain and will setup a non-profit foundation to foster development on the Polkadot Ecosystem - especially in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia), until ultimately transitioning the network to community ownership. The Setheum Network will serve as a building block for DeCo and DeFi applications such as SettIndex in the Polkadot Ecosystem, and will provide new use cases for quality assets in the Polkadot ecosystem, such as DOT and new upcoming Polkadot projects such as Kylin, ChainLink, Open Ethereum et al..

The Setheum Network will include the following parts

    An economic model for the Acala Network and IPO plan et al.
    The STP258 (Setheum Tokenization Protocol [to-fiat]) Stablecoin Standard Module: 34 fiat currencies that can be spent on SettPay and are also represented in a basket token.
    The SERP (Setheum Elastic Reserve Protocol) Token Elasticity Module: Designed to make cryptocurrencies that are backed by other cryptocurrencies with the PES (Price Elasticity of Supply) algorithm utilized for token elasticity of supply (TES) algorithm.
    Setheum Chain using Substrate to enable all in one DeFi & DeCo development and interoperability including the following modules:
        The STP258 Module, which we are developing and is open-sourced for the community to use and build upon
        The SERP Module, which we are developing and is open-sourced for the community to use and build upon
        Various modules specific to manage Distribution of Cashbacks, Ecommerce payment, et al.
    Setheum Network SDKs: to empower developer community to build upon and integrate with the Setheum Network
    SettPay: pay on ecommerce platforms with cryptocurrency, to enable minting of STP258 stablecoins, peer to peer transactions, and later on in the near future we will add Subsocial in the SettPay Dapp as a micro-service just like Alipay chat in AliPay, etc.

Development Roadmap

The Setheum Network MVP will be a 3-month project, aims to deliver a running Substrate chain testnet providing algorithmically elastic stablecoins - the STP258 Sett tokens, the Setheum Built-In DEX for margin trading, liquidity staking with basic (council type) governance. Upon the testnet launch, we will implement a basic version of its economic model and work towards a Canary Network Launch and an Initial Parachain Offering of the Canary network on Kusama. And then work towards an Initial Parachain Offering of the Mainnet of Setheum network, participation in the IPO auction will depend upon the readiness of the Polkadot network.
